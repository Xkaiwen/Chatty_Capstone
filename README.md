# Chatty
Chatty is designed to address the diverse challenges users may face when learning a new language. <br />
It offers three core features: general conversation practice, scenario-based roleplay, and pronunciation practice. <br />
According to two rounds of user research, these functions effectively support users in improving their speaking and reading skills, providing a well-rounded and engaging language learning experience. <br/>
This capstone project is an extension of the Chatty group project from CS239 in Winter 2025. <br>
A possible helpful tutorial to fully understand the functions of Chatty. <br/>
